            <h6>By Madeline Everett</h6>
          <p>The first time I tried a cardamom bun from <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/juno_the_bakery/feed/?hl=en'>Juno the Bakery</a> in Copenhagen, The plush, buttery, strongly spiced bun both sweet and salty was the best pastry I had ever tasted. I would move to Copenhagen for Juno (in fact, I’m thinking about it). This put me on a cardamom spree: I made cardamom syrup, cardamom chai, and cardamom scones. I experimented to recreate the Juno bun, trying and tweaking multiple recipes and journeying to  Indian grocery stores to find cardamom pods.  </p>
          <p>During my cardamom obsession (which is still ongoing), I became curious about cardamom - where did it come from, and why is it vital for so many savory South Asian dishes, and yet so popular in Scandinavian pastry?  </p>
          <p>Cardamom is native to India. The first evidence of trade of cardamom is from the Bronze Age, when it moved to the Mediterranian and western Asia. The Greek physicians Dioscorides and Hippocrates wrote about its medicinal benefits. Today, cardamom is the third most expensive spice in the world after saffron and vanilla. The spice was sought after even in ancient times. </p>
          <p>The first evidence of cardamom in Scandanavia comes from a medieval text called Libellus de Arte Coquina (The Little Book of Cooking Art), from the early 13th century. The recipe that lists cardamom is for a “Lordly Sauce.”</p>
          <p style="text-align:center">"One takes cloves and nutmeg, cardamom, pepper, cinnamon – that is canel – and ginger, all in equal amounts, except that there should be as much canel as all the other spices and add twice as much toasted bread as of everything else, and grind them all together, and blend with strong vinegar, and place it in a cask."</pstyle="text-align:center">
          <p>I examined the New York Times cooking page to see what the most common ingredients are in recipes with cardamom. Almost all of the spices in the Lordly Sauce - except for nutmeg - are in the top ten ingredients paired with cardamom in the New York Times. The flavor combinations are still popular today. </p>
          <h5> Ingredients in medieval cardamom sauce are still popular in cardamom dishes today</h5>
          <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/14387951"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
           <p> </p>
            <p>I also calculated what the most common words in the titles of the recipes. The most common titles reflect the diversity of cardamom today: It is still used in Indian curries, but also to make sweet cakes. </p>
            <h5>Both 'curry' and 'cake' are among the most common words in the names of the recipes with cardamom</h5>
            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/14388354"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
          <p>Half of the recipes containing cardamom also contain sugar. Most of the time, sugar is used in sweets and desserts. So, I looked to see how the most common words changed when I only included recipes with sugar in them. </p>
          <h5>In sugary desserts, cardamom is Queen </h5>
          <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/14388318"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
          <p>While 'cardamom' in the recipe title does not even make the top ten in the list of cardamom recipes, for recipes with sugar, 'cardamom' is the most common word. This suggests that in sweets, cardamom is the ruling ingredient. Examples include: <a  href = 'https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019976-chocolate-cardamom-pots-de-creme'> Choclate-Cardamom Pots de Creme,'</a href = 'https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017855-cardamom-butter-crescents'> <a>Cardamom Butter Cresents,</a> and <a href = https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023914-semlor-cardamom-cream-buns>Cardamom Cream Buns.</a></p>
          <p>Cardamom is an important spice in many parts of the world. It is my favorite spice, and I am glad to know that there are so many interesting recipes to try, from curries and chai to glogg and cardamom buns.</p>
